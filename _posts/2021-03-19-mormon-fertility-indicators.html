  I discovered that the CDC keeps a record of <a href=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data_access/vitalstatsonline.htm>every birth certificate in America</a> going back to 1968 (at least the metadata). You can actually download all the metadata yourself, but the version they let you download redacts all the geographic (county) data. Which makes it kind of useless. BUT you can query the data for certain statistics through <a href=https://wonder.cdc.gov/>wonder.cdc.gov</a>. There are a few things I've been "wondering" about Mormons and their famously-high fertility since I saw <a href=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr68/nvsr68_01-508.pdf>this report</a> which said the white fertility in Utah fell below replacement-level in 2017. So I queried the data for 3 representative geographies: the first obvious one being Utah (the Mormon Mothership) but Utah is pretty multicultural these days so you can't get an accurate picture of what's happening with the Mormons just by looking at Utah. Two much better geographies are Utah County, Utah (home of Brigham Young University) and Bonneville County, Idaho (neighbor of Brigham Young University - Idaho). These two yuge 99% Mormon universities make both of these counties nearly Mormon-monocultural so they should be great indicators of the current fertility rate in the Mormon community. Here are the results:

  The fertilty rate of Utah County fell 28.6% from 3.18 in 2007 to 2.27 in 2019. The White (Non-Hispanic white) fertility rate of Utah County fell 30.1% from 3.11 in 2007 to 2.17 in 2019. The latter is now just barely above-replacement.

  Every value in the "Fertility Rate per 1,000" column of the following tables is an average annual fertility of women over a 30-year age range. To convert to Total Fertility Rate (TFR) just multiply by 30 and divide by 1000.
